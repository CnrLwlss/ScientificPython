<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The first step on the way to using Python is to have the Python interpreter installed on your machine.  The interpreter takes a Python script (a simple text file that you will write), checks that it can understand it (that it is written correctly in the Python language), and if so, it executes the instructions contained in the script.  If the interpreter finds a language error (a syntax error), it helpfully tries to tell you about it and pinpoint the error so that you can correct it.</p>

<h3>Installation difficulties specific to Newcastle University</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, due to our university's security policy, it is no longer possible for students or staff to manually install Python onto university desktop machines.  Generally, computing is much more straightforward if you have administrator rights on your machine.  You can request administrator rights on a Newcastle University desktop machine to allow you to work more effectively, however the university default policy is not to allow this.  In the absence of administrator rights, you can request that your institute's computer support team install Python (and any <a href="../Libraries">libraries</a> required) onto your computer.  Newcastle's <a href="http://www.ncl.ac.uk/itservice/">IT department</a> has expressed its full support for increasing the programming skills of biomedical students and will help.  Please let <a href="conor.lawless@ncl.ac.uk">me</a> know if there are any problems.  Python has been pre-installed on all of the machines in the Dene cluster (which is accessible by all) and should remain installed on those machines for the foreseeable future, however many useful libraries are currently missing.</p>

<h3>Downloading Python</h3>

<h4>Microsoft Windows</h4>
<p>We can <a href="http://python.org/download/">download</a> Python installers for Windows from the Python <a href="http://python.org/download/">download</a> page.  Unless you have a specific reason not to (for instance, working with datasets > 2Gb in size) Windows users should install 32-bit Python (e.g. <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.msi">Windows Installer</a>), regardless of whether you are using a 64-bit machine or a 32-bit machine.</p>

<p>A good alternative method for installing Python along with a wide range of useful scientific programming tools is to install the latest version of Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/">pythonxy</a>.</p>

<h4>Linux & OSX</h4>
<p>Python is installed by default on all versions of linux.  You can check by opening a terminal window and typing <code>python</code> at the command line.  It's best to just use the installed version if you can.  Having multiple versions on one machine can be confusing.</p>

<h4>Which version of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>?</h4>

<p>There are two main versions of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> available: <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.msi">Python2.7.9</a> and <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.3/python-3.4.3.msi">Python3.4.0</a>.  We will use <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.9/python-2.7.9.msi">Python2.7.9</a> just because it has been around for longer and people have developed more supplementary packages for it.  The language syntax is slightly different between Python2.x and Python3.x, and Python3.x will become the standard version in the future, but the differences are quite minor and only become apparent with advanced use.</p>
