<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The first step on the way to using <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is to have the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> interpreter installed on your machine.  The interpreter takes a <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> script (which is simply a text file that you will write), checks that it is written correctly in the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> language, and if so, it executes the algorithm contained in the script.  If the interpreter finds an error, it helpfully tries to tell you about it so that you can fix it.</p>

<h3>Downloading <a href="http://python.org">Python</a></h3>

<p>We can <a href="http://python.org/download/">download</a> <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> installers from the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> <a href="http://python.org/download/">download</a> page.  For this workshop we will assume that you are installing <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> on a Windows machine (typical Newcastle University desktop machine), however, you can find installers for all major operating systems on the same page.</p>

<h3>Which version of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>?</h3>

<p>Currently there are two main versions of <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> available: <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/">Python2.7.2</a> and <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/3.2.2/">Python3.2.2</a>.  We will use <a href="http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.2/">Python2.7.2</a> just because it has been around for longer and people have developed more supplementary packages for it.  The language syntax is slightly different between Python2.x and Python3.x, and Python3.x will become the standard version in the future, but the differences are quite minor and only become apparent with advanced use.</p>


<h3>Installing on Newcastle University MS Windows XP machines</h3>

<p> First, download <a href="http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi">this</a> windows installer file.</p>

<p>Once the windows installer file is downloaded, double click on it to start the installation procedure.  Newcastle University computing policy makes it difficult for you to install software on University desktop machines.  Fortunately, there is a simple work-around for installing Python and that is to change the installation directory from the defult directory "C:\Python27" to the temporary directory "C:\Temp\Python27" during installation.</p>

<p>You will have to go through this installation procedure for any machine you wish to work on which does not have <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> installed already (it will not appear on your profile university wide).  After installation, shortcuts pointing to the <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> IDLE GUI (which we can use for writing scripts) should be available in your windows start menu.</p>

<h3>Installing on Newcastle University MS Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines</h3>

<p>The trick above will not work for Windows 7 machines.  Here the alternative is to request that your institute's computer support team install Python (and any <a href="../Libraries">libraries</a> required) onto your computer.  The university's IT department has expressed its full support for increasing the programming skills of biomedical postgraduates and will help.  Please let me know if there are any problems.  Python has been pre-installed on all of the machines in the Dene cluster (which is accessible by all) and should remain installed on those machines for the forseeable future.</p>
